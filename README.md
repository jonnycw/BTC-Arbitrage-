### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to practice and apply the 3 stages of financial analysis:

1. Collect the data
2. Prepare the data
3. Analyze the data

### General Findings

As the months go by, the degree of spread between the two exchanges got smaller. The January 1 to February 1 time period shows a significantly greater degree of spread compared to the March 1 - March 31 time period.

In addiiton, as the spread between the two exchanges gets smaller, the profit is also smaller (being non-existent on March 26th, 2018). On January 16, 2018, the more profitable trades occurred at the beginning and end of the day. On February 24th, 2018, the more profitable trades occured at the end of the day.


More analysis is needed to confirm whether these trends hold true for the average day in the respective month.
